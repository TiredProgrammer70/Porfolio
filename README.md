Hello everyone, this is my portfolio where i showcase all of the video games i've made during my studies and work experience.

I've worked mostly with Unity during my studies, learning different styles of video games to make with it. I've also dipped my toes a bit in other languages such as: C++, Html, JavaScript. 

### Slay The Corrupted

Slay the Corrupted was my final project during my studies, we had between 2 and 3 months to develop and create it with a team of 3. I was appointed as the leader of the project and game because i came up with the idea and wrote it on paper. 

The idea for this project was to create the base of a game that was fun and completed enough that could be considered a game. To achieve that, we decided to add RogueLike elements to each "run" or play, randomly creating the map each time with a complex code made by myself.

(Some maps generated by the code)

As I've said, the map randomly generates randomly each time through an algorithm that i made, letting me assign X number of special rooms that the map has to include.

To ease the creation of the map, I used my logic and creative thinking to simplifiy the code, creating a function that gets called when the maps is created that, converting each possible door that a room can have, into a binary version, assigning it a power of 2, that way, each of the 15 possible combinations of 4 door-ways, has an easily recognizable number

```
public int DoorTypes() {
   int valueDoors = 0;

   if (doorUp) valueDoors +=1;
   if (doorBot) valueDoors +=2;
   if (doorLeft) valueDoors +=4;
   if (doorRight) valueDoors +=8;

   return valueDoors;
}
```


Aside from working on the randomizer algorithm, we also worked on the creation and use of GameManagers to control the game and it's needs, and Abstract and Inherited classes, facilitating the reuse of code on different and multiple 

Mi parte of the project what the creation of maps and the AI of the final boss of the game, made with an algorithm of phases that cicled through them in a clean and compact manner, letting me add more attacks or letting me add that behaviour onto other enemies.

### Space Shooter for Android

This was my first game during my second year of studying programming, it was an Arcade style with replayability, it came from the need to learn programmation and modelling in 3D, applying physics to the shots of the player, the player itself and the enemy spwaning code.

A system was applied to let the player upgrade his character permanently during the game, unlocking the upgrades with the in-game currency, said upgrades being permanent even if you closed the game.

Once you start the game, it's a Shoot-em Up arcade style, having a time limit to shoot the different objectives that keep on appearing all around, some of them giving bonuses to ease up the match or get more rewards.

### SpaceScape

SpaceScape was my final project during my first year, made in a month during quarantine.

SpaceScape was made as a 2D platformer to practice the physics in 2D, learning about all the different applications of them and the different configurations you could apply to create different gravity, movement, jumps, etc.

In this project, I also learned how to create and apply parallax through code, the functionality that makes the background object follow the player at different speeds, creating a deeper sense of movement.

### Challenge Tower

</p>

Challenge tower was my first video game project during my studies, it helped me learn the bases of Unity and game development, learning to program different types of functions, such as events and corroutines.

It also was the start of learning how to import and cofigure animation inside Unity.

</p>


My part of the project was a bit more than half of it, having made it with a partner during my studies, it helped me improve my teamwork applied to programming.
